In this project, a spam filter is built for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% â€” so it is expected that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or non-spam.

To train the algorithm, a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages is used, that are already classified by humans. The dataset can be downloaded from the The UCI Machine Learning Repository.
